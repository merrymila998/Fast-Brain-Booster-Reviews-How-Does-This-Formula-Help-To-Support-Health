<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you think it’s just another “miracle” pill, hang on. Neuro-Thrive is different. It’s not about a quick fix but more like good food for your brain’s battery—the mitochondria. Imagine this as your brain’s personal trainer, helping you build mental muscle for the long run.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what’s in store for you in this article? We’re diving deep into Neuro-Thrive: what it does, what’s in it, and how it could be a game-changer for you. Plus, we’ll talk about some other ways to keep your mind sharp. Intrigued? Let’s get into it!</span>

&nbsp;

<b>What is Neuro-Thrive?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, let’s get to the heart of the matter: What exactly is Neuro-Thrive? You know how we sometimes say, “I wish there was a magic button to make things better?” Well, Neuro-Thrive isn’t a magic button, but it’s pretty darn close when it comes to boosting your brainpower.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first, let’s clear up a common misconception. Neuro-Thrive isn’t just another supplement claiming to jazz up your memory. Nope, it’s not in the league of those dime-a-dozen pills that promise a mental makeover overnight. It’s actually rooted in some deep science. The cool thing? It goes right to the heart of what could be causing memory glitches by giving your brain’s mitochondria a nutritional boost. Yeah, you heard that right. It’s like feeding super-fuel to your brain’s engine room—the mitochondria. If you’ve ever craved a way to keep your memory fresh and zesty like a teenager’s, Neuro-Thrive could be your golden ticket.</span>

It’s a thoughtfully designed recipe aimed to help you live life with a mental edge. Imagine cruising through your day, smashing it at work, and still having the mental juice left to enjoy a good book or solve a Sudoku puzzle before bed.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But let’s slow down for a sec and be real. Although Neuro-Thrive offers a whole bunch of pluses for your gray matter, it’s not a miracle in a capsule. It’s a tool, and like any tool, you’ll get the best results when you use it correctly. You know how a gym membership only works if you actually go and lift those weights? Same logic here. Combining Neuro-Thrive with a balanced lifestyle could really unlock some next-level mental acumen for you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Secret Sauce: Ingredients in Neuro-Thrive</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, so you’re probably wondering what makes Neuro-Thrive the talk of the town. It’s time to peel back the curtain and unveil the ingredients that put the “Thrive” in Neuro-Thrive. Trust me, this is the stuff that makes your neurons do a happy dance.</span>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li><b> PQQ: The Brain’s Guardian Angel</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with PQQ, or Pyrroloquinoline Quinone if you’re feeling fancy. This ingredient is like a VIP bouncer for your brain, making sure everything is in tip-top shape. Picture PQQ as the mentor to your brain cells’ power plants, the mitochondria. And oh boy, it doesn’t stop there. PQQ also amps up the production of NGF, which is like the protective momma bear for your neurons. Basically, it’s the superhero ingredient your brain didn’t know it needed.</span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
 	<li><b> Bacopa: The Himalayan Wonder</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up, Bacopa, a herb so cool it’s got roots in Ayurvedic medicine. And we’re not talking about any old Ayurvedic medicine; this stuff is like the memory-enhancing ancient secret passed down from Himalayan sages. Bacopa is all about creating more connections in your brain. Think of it as upgrading your brain’s internet speed; things just work smoother and faster.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Neuro-Thrive: Try it now, you won’t be disappointed!</span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
 	<li><b> Alpha GPC: Brain Fuel, Anyone?</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine having a loyal sidekick whose only job is to make you look good. That’s Alpha GPC for your brain. This ingredient turns into choline, which is basically the building block for acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that’s like the high-speed train for your thoughts. The result? You stay sharp, even when the candles on your birthday cake start to resemble a small bonfire.</span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
 	<li><b> GABA: The Zen Master</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">GABA is the ingredient that helps you keep your cool. Known for its calming effects, GABA is that friend who tells you to take a deep breath when you’re stressed. But get this: GABA doesn’t just help you sleep better; it also helps you think sharper. That’s like getting extra guacamole for free.</span>

&nbsp;
<ol start="5">
 	<li><b> Vitamin Blend: The All-Rounder</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t build a brain-boosting powerhouse without throwing in some essential vitamins. Vitamin D3 is the star of the show, especially if you’re getting up there in years. And let’s not forget the dynamic duo of B3 and B6. These vitamins are the cleanup crew for stuff like homocysteine, which is not something you want loitering around in your system.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, there you have it. Neuro-Thrive isn’t just another pill you pop and forget about. It’s a finely-tuned blend of ingredients designed to make sure your brain doesn’t just survive but thrives. This is the future, folks. Welcome aboard the Neuro-Thrive train, next stop: cognitive excellence.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Real Deal: How Neuro-Thrive Works, According to Science</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alright, let’s get to the point. You might be thinking, “Sure, Neuro-Thrive sounds good, but does it actually work?” Well, let’s dig into the science behind it, shall we?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First off, this isn’t some random mix of ingredients. Nope. Real studies backup what Neuro-Thrive claims to do. For example, a study in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease looked at how PQQ helps improve memory and brain function in older adults. So, it’s not just talk; it’s the real deal!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But wait, there’s more to love about this supplement. Bacopa, that herb from the Himalayas, has also been put to the test. A study in another journal found that it improves working memory and how fast your brain processes info. Seriously, the science checks out.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the official website, Total Brain Boost can sharpen focus, boost memory, and increased energy by activating a specific part of your brain linked to cognition.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Does Total Brain Boost live up to the hype? Can Total Brain Boost really transform your brain? Keep reading to find out everything you need to know about Total Brain Boost and how it works today in our review.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Total Brain Boost?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Total Brain Boost is a nutritional supplement featuring a blend of natural ingredients to target brain health, cognition, and memory.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Total Brain Boost is promoted online by Dr. Steven Masley, MD, CNS.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Masley is a Fellow of the American Heart Association and the American College of Nutrition. He’s also known for running the Masley Optimal Health Center in St. Petersburg, Florida, which he founded in 2007.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2013, Dr. Masley has sold health guides, supplements, and other products through a separate company called Steven Masley MD, LLC.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last three decades, Dr. Masley claims to have helped thousands of patients strengthen their memory and improve cognition at all ages. He used his experience treating cognitive patients to promote Total Brain Boost.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Total Brain Boost formula itself was created by Revival Point, LLC. Revival Point, LLC partnered with Dr. Masley to endorse Total Brain Boost. Dr. Masley did not formulate Total Brain Boost, although he does promote the supplement online.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the six ingredients in Total Brain Boost are the exact six ingredients Dr. Masley recommends for healthy brain aging as part of his cerebral boost method.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Total Brain Boost is available through TotalBrainBoost.com, where it’s priced at around $59.95 for a one-month supply.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Total Brain Boost Benefits</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Dr. Masley and his team at Total Brain Boost, you can enjoy the following benefits by taking two capsules of Total Brain Boost daily:</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Boost mental energy</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Support stronger memory</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy sharper focus, mental clarity, thinking, and processing</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve mood and outlook</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Restore healthy vitamin and mineral levels</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Boost antioxidant defense via natural anti-inflammatory ingredients</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How Does Total Brain Boost Work?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of nootropic supplements that claim to boost memory and focus. Some work, while others don’t. So how does Total Brain Boost work?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Total Brain Boost works by delivering a blend of shelf-stable nutrients to you via a capsule. You swallow two capsules of Total Brain Boost daily, then let the ingredients go to work.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The ingredients in Total Brain Boost include antioxidant-rich herb and plant extracts like curcumin and trans-resveratrol. It also includes vitamins and minerals your brain needs to function correctly – including vitamin D, vitamin B12, folate, and magnesium bisglycinate.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All six ingredients in Total Brain Boost are part of Dr. Masley’s “cerebral boost method,” which he claims has been helping thousands of patients solve cognitive issues over the last decade. Those six ingredients, in precise doses, have been shown to promote cognition, healthy brain aging, and other benefits.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Total Brain Boost: Your key to enhanced cognition!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is Dr. Steven Masley?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Total Brain Boost is promoted online by Dr. Steven Masley. Although Dr. Masley did not personally develop the formula, he did develop a “cerebral boost method” that complements the effects of Total Brain Boost. Plus, Total Brain Boost manufacturer Revival Point, LLC partnered with Dr. Masley to endorse the formula online.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Dr. Masley is featured prominently across the Total Brain Boost website.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Masley has personally treated thousands of patients for age-related issues – including low physical and cognitive energy, poor memory, and overall weakness.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Masley was particularly motivated to solve age-related cognitive issues when his friend, Chuck, struggled with the condition for years, eventually dying in a hospice. On his deathbed, Chuck told Dr. Masley that he didn’t want anyone else to suffer from the same issues. Since then, Dr. Masley made it his mission to solve age-related issues.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To make a long story short, Dr. Masley used his experience in medicine to create his cerebral boost method and published multiple books on healthy aging – including The Better Brain Solution and The 30 Day Heart Tune-Up.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, you can use that cerebral boost method to complement the effects of Total Brain Boost, a supplement that Dr. Masley personally endorses.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Total Brain Boost Targets the Forebrain, the Root Cause of Cognitive Issues</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Total Brain Boost targets a specific part of the brain called the forebrain.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you get older, your forebrain experiences “synaptic slowdown.” Your connections between brain cells, or synapses, slow down over time, causing your brain to slow down.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of synaptic slowdown in your forebrain, you’re more likely to make poor choices, have bad memory, and think more slowly.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Dr. Masley’s research, synaptic slowdown is influenced by three factors, including:</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Factor #1: We Eat Too Much Processed Food: Much of the food we eat is loaded with refined sugars and other processed ingredients.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Factor #2: Today’s Food is Less Nutritious Than Ever: According to Dr. Masley, “most people today are grossly nutritionally insufficient.” Even if you eat a healthy diet, the food you eat may not have the same nutrients it did decades ago.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Factor #3: Food Contains Record Levels of Toxins, Pesticides, Preservatives, &amp; Additives: Our food is loaded with harmful substances, including toxins, pesticides, preservatives, and additives. The more toxins you absorb, the higher your risk of disease and illness.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These three factors increase the risk of brain cells dying. By taking Total Brain Boost daily, you could fight back against synaptic slowdown, targeting the forebrain to eliminate the root cause of cognitive slowdown.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Total Brain Boost Is On Sale Now For A Limited Time!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What to Expect After Taking Total Brain Boost</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Dr. Masley, you could experience the following effects by taking Total Brain Boost daily:</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Boost Mental Energy: Total Brain Boost contains a collection of nutrients to help brain cells produce energy while also increasing growth factors shown to help grow new brain cells. Up until recently, researchers were unaware we could grow new brain cells. Today, the six ingredients in Total Brain Boost can boost mental energy by producing new brain cells.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Support Stronger Memory: </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many adults experience memory issues as they get older. Total Brain Boost claims to help support stronger memory using a blend of nutrients. Specifically, the nutrients in Total Brain Boost combat “beta amyloid,” the sticky brain plaque linked to Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, memory loss, and other issues. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, regular usage of Total Brain Boost “helps restore the single most important nutrient deficiency linked to memory loss in adults.” By giving your brain the nutrients it needs to support memory and cognition, Total Brain Boost can ensure your memory remains strong for years into the future.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Support Sharper Focus &amp; Mental Clarity: Your focus and overall mental clarity tends to weaken with age. Total Brain Boost claims to help using a blend of anti-inflammatory ingredients and natural antioxidants, helping you enjoy a razor sharp mind at any age. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These anti-inflammatory ingredients and antioxidants can boost cerebral blood flow and reduce blood sugar levels, fighting back against cognitive aging in two ways.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Faster Thinking &amp; Processing: Similar to focus and clarity, thinking and processing drop with age. Your brain synapses may not connect as quickly as they did when you were younger. Fortunately, </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Total Brain Boost claims to help by giving your brain synapses the nutrition they need for faster thinking and processing. Some customers find they have an easier time carrying conversations and remembering things after taking Total Brain Boost.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Better Mood &amp; Outlook: Total Brain Boost can help improve mood and outlook, according to the manufacturer, by targeting oxidative stress, neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, and other factors that influence mood. By protecting against oxidative stress, the ingredients in Total Brain Boost can control inflammation in your brain, potentially improving irritability, anxiety, and overall mood.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Total Brain Boost contains a blend of six active ingredients, including root extracts, vitamins, minerals, and natural antioxidants.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Total Brain Boost formula was not developed by Dr. Masley, the six ingredients within the supplement are all recommended by Dr. Masley as part of his cerebral boost method. In fact, these are the only six ingredients Dr. Masley recommends as part of the method:</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve recommended these same nutrients to hundreds of my patients and thousands of my followers….There are six nutrients that I’ve found are the best at boosting the brain.”</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are all of the active ingredients in Total Brain Boost and how they work:</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brain Boosting Nutrient #1: CurcuRouge (Bio-Optimized Curcumin): Dr. Masley claims curcumin is “at the top of my list of brain nutrients” because it reduces inflammation in the brain. Curcumin may also reduce the production of beta amyloid plaque in the brain – the plaque linked to memory loss and degenerative brain conditions. Some also use curcumin to reduce joint pain, boost physical energy, and improve other aspects of health and wellness. However, Total Brain Boost doesn’t just contain ordinary turmeric and curcumin, which are difficult for your body to absorb; instead, it contains a special type of curcumin called CurcuRouge, which is designed to maximize bioavailability and absorption.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brain Boosting Nutrient #2: Trans-Resveratrol: Studies show resveratrol can boost memory and improve cognition in other ways. In one study, people taking resveratrol over 12 months enhanced cognition and blood flow to the brain, which could slow cognitive decline due to aging. Total Brain Boost contains a specific type of resveratrol called trans-resveratrol, which is the best resveratrol for absorption.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brain Boosting Nutrient #3: Magnesium Bisglycinate: Magnesium “is essential for messaging to occur between brain cells,” according to Dr. Masley. If your magnesium levels are low, then your brain messaging slows down. Unfortunately, 68% of Americans are low in magnesium, increasing the risk of cognitive health issues. Magnesium is also crucial for heart health, nerve function, blood flow, and more. While other supplements contain magnesium oxide (which is cheap and plentiful), </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Total Brain Boost contains magnesium bisglycinate for superior absorption.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brain Boosting Nutrient #4: Vitamin B12: Vitamin B12 “helps brain cells produce energy,” according to Dr. Masley, and low vitamin B12 levels are linked to poor learning and memory. Dr. Masley cites one study where vitamin B12 supplementation reduced brain shrinkage, helping with memory loss. Unfortunately, vitamin B12 deficiency is more common today than ever. Many vegans and vegetarians are deficient in vitamin B12, for example, because there are few plant-based sources of vitamin B12. People with stomach disorders may also have low levels of vitamin B12 because of the way certain drugs work.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brain Boosting Nutrient #5: Folate: Folate works with vitamins D and B12 to promote energy metabolism and fight back against cognitive decline. It’s been shown to help with learning ability, memory, and overall cognition in older adults.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brain Boosting Nutrient #6: Vitamin D: People with higher vitamin D levels “appear to have larger brains than people with low vitamin D levels,” according to Dr. Masley. That’s because vitamin D is closely tied to brain function. Vitamin D works with vitamin B12 and folate to boost energy metabolism and fight cognitive decline.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By mixing all six of these ingredients together in the right dosages, you get a powerful combination that can boost memory, focus, and overall brain function, according to Dr. Masley.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Total Brain Boost formula is non-GMO, allergen-free, vegetarian, dairy-free, gluten-free, and made in a GMP-certified facility in the United States.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For a vibrant brain health, choose Total Brain Boost!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Total Brain Boost is the Ideal Version of Dr. Masley’s Cerebral Boost Method</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Total Brain Boost was not created by Dr. Steven Masley. However, the formula contains all six ingredients recommended in Dr. Masley’s cerebral boost method.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Masley used to recommend all six of these natural ingredients to his patients for years. He told his patients to buy the ingredients on their own.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, buying all six separate ingredients was time-consuming and expensive. That’s why Dr. Masley was happy to partner with Revival Point, which created Total Brain Boost with all six of Dr. Masley’s recommended ingredients.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Total Brain Boost is the only health supplement that contains all six of these brain-enhancing nutrients I discovered in my last 30 years of research,” explains Dr. Masley. Dr. Masley also likes the supplement for containing the right dosages and concentrations of all six active ingredients.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientific Evidence for Total Brain Boost</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As proof Total Brain Boost works, Revival Point cites the work of Dr. Masley. The company also cites six studies published in peer-reviewed medical journals to validate the six active ingredients within Total Brain Boost. We’ll review that research below to determine how Total Brain Boost works.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Revival Point cites a 2020 study showing low vitamin B12 levels could increase the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. In fact, researchers found vitamin B12 deficiency was “an underestimated cause” of cognitive impairment and dementia. When you don’t get enough vitamin B12, your body struggles with poor myelination, which makes it harder for neurotransmitters to send messages. Some older adults undergo vitamin B12 replacement therapy, while others take vitamin B12 supplements or supplements like Total Brain boost to replenish vitamin B12.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2017 study published in Current Gerontology and Geriatrics Research found similar results for vitamin D deficiency. Researchers in Malaysia analyzed a group of 300 adults aged 60 and older. Researchers found adults with low levels of vitamin D tended to have lower levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and shorter telomeres compared to those with ample vitamin D. Like vitamin B12 deficiency, vitamin D deficiency could be an underrated cause of dementia and cognitive issues.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Magnesium deficiency could also impact cognitive decline. As proof, Revival Point cites a 2022 study connecting magnesium intake with cognition in US Adults. The study involved 2,508 participants age 60 and older across the country. Researchers found low magnesium, calcium, and vitamin D levels were linked to poor cognition in older adults.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Resveratrol could support cognition. A 2020 study published in Nutrients found resveratrol helped with brain blood flow and overall cognition in postmenopausal women, which could help with cognition and overall brain performance.
